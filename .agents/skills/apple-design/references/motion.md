# Apple design reference

Design heuristics, subordinate to the project design and accessibility contracts.

## 1. Response — kill latency

The moment lag appears, the feeling of directness "falls off a cliff." Response is the foundation everything else is built on.

- **Respond on pointer-down, not on release.** Highlight a button the instant it's pressed. Waiting for `click`/touch-up to show feedback feels dead.
- **Be vigilant about every latency.** Audit debounces, artificial timers, transition waits, and the ~300ms tap delay. Anything on the input path that isn't essential is a regression.
- **Feedback must be continuous _during_ the interaction, not just at the end.** For a drag, slider, or drawer, update the UI 1:1 with the pointer the whole way through — never animate only when the gesture completes.

```css
/* Feedback lives on the press, and it's instant */
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  transition: transform 100ms ease-out;
}
```

## 2. Direct manipulation — 1:1 tracking

> "Touch and content should move together."

When the user drags something, it must stay glued to the finger — and respect the offset from _where they grabbed it_. Snapping to the element's center on grab breaks the illusion immediately.

- Use Pointer Events with `setPointerCapture` so tracking continues even when the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- Track a short **velocity/position history** (last few `pointermove` events), not just the current point — you'll need velocity at release.

```js
el.addEventListener("pointerdown", (e) => {
  el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);
  const grabOffset = e.clientY - el.getBoundingClientRect().top; // respect where they grabbed
  // ...track position + timestamp history for velocity
});
```

## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

For reversible gestures, let the user grab a moving element mid-flight and redirect it without waiting for the animation to finish. A closing drawer grabbed again should follow the finger from its current position.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Always animate from the _presentation_ (current) value, never the target value.** On interrupt, read the element's live on-screen transform and start the new animation from there. Starting from the logical/target value causes a visible jump.
- **Check cancellation and retargeting in the current implementation.** A fixed-start animation may jump if restarted; transitions, keyframes and springs need to preserve the visible state when interrupted.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.** Replacing one animation with another at a reversal creates a velocity discontinuity, a "brick wall." Spring libraries that carry velocity through a re-target avoid it. (This is what iOS's _additive animations_ do natively; on the web, choose a spring library that re-targets from the current velocity.)
- **Decompose 2D motion into independent X and Y springs.** A single spring on a 2D distance desyncs when X and Y have different velocities.

## 4. Behavior over animation — when springs help

> "Think of animation as a conversation between you and the object, not something prescribed by the interface."

A spring can carry momentum through a change of target, which is useful for gestures that reverse or continue after release. Keep an existing transition or animation when its cancellation and retargeting already fit the interaction.

Apple deliberately replaced the physics triplet (mass/stiffness/damping) with two designer-friendly parameters. Think in these:

- **Damping ratio** — controls overshoot. `1.0` = critically damped, no bounce, smooth settle. `< 1.0` = overshoots and oscillates. Lower = bouncier.
- **Response** — how quickly the value reaches the target, in seconds. Lower = snappier. **This is not "duration"** — a spring has no fixed duration; its settle time emerges from the parameters.

**Defaults:**

- Start most UI at **damping `1.0`** (critically damped) — graceful and non-distracting.
- Add bounce (**damping ~`0.8`**) **only when the gesture itself carried momentum** (a flick, a throw, a drag release). Overshoot on a menu that just faded in feels wrong; overshoot on a card you flicked feels right.

**Concrete values Apple ships:**

| Interaction                  | Damping | Response |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Move / reposition (e.g. PiP) | `1.0`   | `0.4`    |
| Rotation                     | `0.8`   | `0.4`    |
| Drawer / sheet               | `0.8`   | `0.3`    |

**Web mapping (Motion / Framer Motion):** the `bounce` + `duration` spring API offers a similar way to tune feel. For a gesture that needs a spring, the examples below start without bounce and add it for momentum-driven motion; use the installed library's actual parameter semantics.

```js
import { animate } from "motion";

// Critically damped default (no overshoot)
animate(el, { y: 0 }, { type: "spring", bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });

// Momentum interaction — a little bounce, only because a flick preceded it
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: "spring", bounce: 0.2, duration: 0.4 });
```

## 5. Velocity handoff — the seam between drag and animation

When a gesture ends, the animation must **continue at the finger's exact velocity**, so there's no visible seam between dragging and animating. This is the detail that most separates "fluid" from "fine."

Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity. Some spring APIs want **relative** velocity — normalize it by the remaining distance to the target:

```text
relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue − currentValue)
```

Example: element at `y=50`, target `y=150` (100px to go), finger moving 50px/s → initial spring velocity = `50 / 100 = 0.5`. Framer Motion / Motion take absolute px/s velocity directly (`velocity` option), so you usually hand it the raw value.

## 6. Momentum projection — animate to where the gesture is _going_

> "Take a small input and make a big output."

Don't snap to the nearest boundary from the _release point_. Use velocity to **project the resting position** — exactly like scroll deceleration — then snap to the target nearest that projected point. This is what makes a flick feel like it throws the element.

Apple's exact projection function (from the _Designing Fluid Interfaces_ sample code):

```js
// decelerationRate ≈ 0.998 for normal scroll feel; 0.99 for snappier
function project(initialVelocity /* px/s */, decelerationRate = 0.998) {
  return ((initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate) / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint); // choose target from the projection
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity }); // then hand off velocity (§5)
```

Note: the physics-textbook `v²/(2·decel)` is _not_ what Apple ships — use the exponential-decay form above. This is the standard behavior in good bottom-sheets and carousels (Vaul, Embla).

## 7. Spatial consistency — symmetric paths, anchored origins

> "If something disappears one way, we expect it to emerge from where it came."

- **Enter and exit along the same path.** A panel that slides in from the right must dismiss to the right. In-from-right / out-the-bottom feels disconnected and confusing.
- **Anchor interactions to their source.** A menu, popover, or sheet should originate from the element that triggered it — set `transform-origin` to the trigger, so the spatial relationship between button and content is obvious. (This is the same origin-awareness point as popovers scaling from their trigger, not their center.)
- **Mirror the easing on reversible transitions** so the outbound path matches the return path (use inverse cubic-bézier control points for the two directions).

## 8. Hint in the direction of the gesture

Humans predict a final state from a trajectory. Intermediate motion should telegraph where things are going — Control Center modules "grow up and out toward your finger." Make the in-between frames point at the outcome, not just interpolate blindly to it.

## 9. Rubber-banding — soft boundaries

At an edge, resist progressively instead of stopping hard. A hard stop reads as "frozen"; continuous resistance reads as "responsive, but there's nothing more here." Apply damping that increases the further past the boundary the user drags.

```js
// The further past the bound, the less the element follows — real things slow before they stop
function rubberband(overshoot, dimension, constant = 0.55) {
  return (overshoot * dimension * constant) / (dimension + constant * Math.abs(overshoot));
}
```

## 10. Gesture design details (the "feel" checklist)

- **Tap:** highlight on touch-_down_ (instant), commit on touch-_up_. Add ~10px of hysteresis/hit padding around the target, and allow cancel-by-dragging-away and back.
- **Drag/swipe:** require a small movement threshold (hysteresis, ~10px) before committing to a direction, then track 1:1.
- **Detect all plausible gestures in parallel from the first move**, then confidently cancel the losers once intent is clear. Avoid recognizers that only report a _final_ state (`swipeleft`-type events) — they throw away the continuous tracking you need for feedback.
- **Minimize disambiguation delays.** Double-tap detection unavoidably delays single taps; only pay that cost where double-tap truly exists.

## 11. Frame-level smoothness

Smoothness is about _what's in the frames_, not just the frame rate.

- Keep the per-frame positional change below the perception threshold to avoid strobing.
- For very fast motion, a subtle **motion blur / stretch** encodes speed and reads better than a hard sharp streak.
- `requestAnimationFrame` is the web's display-synced clock (Apple uses `CADisplayLink`). Animate only compositor-friendly properties — `transform` and `opacity` — and hint with `will-change` where motion is imminent.

## 12. Materials & depth — translucency conveys hierarchy

Apple uses translucent materials as a floating functional layer that brings structure without stealing focus. On the web, approximate with `backdrop-filter`.

- **Build nav/toolbars/sheets as translucent layers** (`backdrop-filter: blur()` + a semi-transparent background) with content scrolling underneath — not opaque bars that consume a fixed strip.
- **Material weight encodes hierarchy:** darker/heavier materials separate structural regions (sidebars); lighter materials draw attention to interactive elements (buttons). **Never stack a light translucent surface on another** — legibility collapses.
- **Bigger surfaces should read as thicker:** stronger blur + a deeper shadow than small chips. Consider context-aware shadow — heavier over busy/text content for separation, lighter over plain backgrounds.
- **Dim to focus, separate to keep flow.** A modal task pairs the surface with a dimming scrim and pushes the background back/down. A parallel, non-blocking panel uses translucency and offset _without_ a scrim so the flow isn't broken. For stacked sheets, progressively dim and push back each parent layer.
- **Vibrancy keeps text legible over changing backgrounds.** Over blurred/translucent surfaces, don't use flat gray text — use higher-contrast, slightly heavier weight, and a small letter-spacing bump. Put color on a solid layer, not the translucent foreground.
- **Scroll edge effects, not hard dividers.** Instead of a 1px border under a sticky header, fade a small blur/gradient mask where content meets floating chrome — only where floating UI actually overlaps content.
- **Materialize, don't just fade.** For glass/blur surfaces, animate blur radius and scale together on enter/exit, so the surface reads as a real material arriving rather than a plain opacity fade.

```css
.toolbar {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4); /* bright top edge = light catching the material */
}
```

## 13. Multimodal feedback — motion + sound + haptics

Three rules for combining senses (from _Designing Audio-Haptic Experiences_):

1. **Causality** — it must be obvious what caused the feedback. Trigger it on the actual causal event (the toggle flipping, the item snapping home), and match its character to the action's physicality.
2. **Harmony** — the visual, the sound, and the haptic must fire on the **same frame**. Latency between them destroys the illusion. Don't let a CSS transition lag the audio/haptic (Vibration API).
3. **Utility** — add feedback only where it earns its place. Reserve haptics/sound for meaningful moments (success, error, commit, snap). Over-feedback trains users to ignore all of it.

## 14. Reduced motion & accessibility

Reduced motion doesn't mean _no_ feedback — it means a gentler, non-vestibular equivalent. Respond to three independent signals and bake them into your components:

- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — replace slides/springs/parallax with short opacity **cross-fades or static transitions**. Drop elastic/overshoot. Keep opacity/color changes that aid comprehension.
- **`prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce`** — make translucent surfaces frostier/solid: raise background opacity, drop the blur.
- **`prefers-contrast: more`** — near-solid backgrounds with a defined, contrasting border.

Also: avoid full-viewport moving backgrounds, slow looping oscillations (near 0.2 Hz / one cycle per 5s), and abrupt brightness jumps (ease dark↔light theme changes). Make large moving objects semi-transparent while they travel, and fade big surfaces out during a large reposition and back in once settled.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .sheet {
    transition: opacity 200ms ease;
    transform: none !important;
  }
}
@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) {
  .toolbar {
    background: white;
    backdrop-filter: none;
  }
}
```
