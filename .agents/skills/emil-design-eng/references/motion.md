## The Animation Decision Framework

Use the relevant questions when choosing feedback; no fixed questionnaire is required.

### 1. Should this animate at all?

**Ask:** How often will users see this animation?

| Frequency                                                   | Decision                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | Prefer immediate feedback.   |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation)          | Remove or drastically reduce |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts)                        | Standard animation           |
| Rare/first-time (onboarding, feedback forms, celebrations)  | Can add delight              |

Frequent keyboard actions should respond immediately. Check that feedback preserves focus and does not delay repeated input.

Raycast has no open/close animation. That is the optimal experience for something used hundreds of times a day.

### 2. What is the purpose?

Every animation must have a clear answer to "why does this animate?"

Valid purposes:

- **Spatial consistency**: toast enters and exits from the same direction, making swipe-to-dismiss feel intuitive
- **State indication**: a morphing feedback button shows the state change
- **Explanation**: a marketing animation that shows how a feature works
- **Feedback**: a button scales down on press, confirming the interface heard the user
- **Preventing jarring changes**: elements appearing or disappearing without transition feel broken

If the purpose is just "it looks cool" and the user will see it often, don't animate.

### 3. What easing should it use?

Is the element entering or exiting?
Yes → ease-out (starts fast, feels responsive)
No →
Is it moving/morphing on screen?
Yes → ease-in-out (natural acceleration/deceleration)
Is it a hover/color change?
Yes → ease
Is it constant motion (marquee, progress bar)?
Yes → linear
Default → ease-out

Reuse the project and component easing tokens. These custom curves are examples for a task that needs different motion, not a requirement to replace existing curves.

```css
/* Strong ease-out for UI interactions */
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);

/* Strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);

/* iOS-like drawer curve (from Ionic Framework) */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
```

Slow-start easing can delay visible feedback on entry. Assess the actual interaction rather than treating the curve name as a defect.

**Easing curve resources:** Don't create curves from scratch. Use [easing.dev](https://easing.dev/) or [easings.co](https://easings.co/) to find stronger custom variants of standard easings.

### 4. How fast should it be?

| Element                  | Duration      |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Button press feedback    | 100-160ms     |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125-200ms     |
| Dropdowns, selects       | 150-250ms     |
| Modals, drawers          | 200-500ms     |
| Marketing/explanatory    | Can be longer |

Use the project motion budget and verify responsiveness. Example ranges are not hard limits; do not change a spinner merely to imply faster data loading.

### Perceived performance

Speed in animation is not just about feeling snappy — it directly affects how users perceive your app's performance:

- Use accurate loading states and stable content; animation alone does not demonstrate a performance improvement
- A **180ms select** animation feels more responsive than a **400ms** one
- **Instant tooltips** after the first one is open (skip delay + skip animation) make the whole toolbar feel faster

The perception of speed matters as much as actual speed. Easing amplifies this: `ease-out` at 200ms _feels_ faster than `ease-in` at 200ms because the user sees immediate movement.

## Spring Animations

Springs feel more natural than duration-based animations because they simulate real physics. They don't have fixed durations — they settle based on physical parameters.

### When to use springs

- Drag interactions with momentum
- Elements that should feel "alive" (like Apple's Dynamic Island)
- Gestures that can be interrupted mid-animation
- Decorative mouse-tracking interactions

### Spring-based mouse interactions

Tying visual changes directly to mouse position feels artificial because it lacks motion. Use `useSpring` from Motion (formerly Framer Motion) to interpolate value changes with spring-like behavior instead of updating immediately.

```jsx
import { useSpring } from "framer-motion";

// Without spring: feels artificial, instant
const rotation = mouseX * 0.1;

// With spring: feels natural, has momentum
const springRotation = useSpring(mouseX * 0.1, {
  stiffness: 100,
  damping: 10,
});
```

This works because the animation is **decorative** — it doesn't serve a function. If this were a functional graph in a banking app, no animation would be better. Know when decoration helps and when it hinders.

### Spring configuration

**Apple's approach (recommended — easier to reason about):**

```js
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }
```

**Traditional physics (more control):**

```js
{ type: "spring", mass: 1, stiffness: 100, damping: 10 }
```

Keep bounce subtle (0.1-0.3) when used. Avoid bounce in most UI contexts. Use it for drag-to-dismiss and playful interactions.

### Interruptibility advantage

Springs that preserve position and velocity while retargeting are useful for gestures users may reverse mid-motion. Check the actual interruption behavior: rapidly expanding an item and pressing Escape should continue from the visible state. A transition or other animation can also meet that requirement; a fixed-start animation may jump if restarted.
