## Stagger Animations

When a sequence helps communicate order or hierarchy, stagger can give each entering element a small delay. Simultaneous or immediate appearance is also appropriate; choose based on the page's purpose and interaction frequency.

```css
.item {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(8px);
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out forwards;
}

.item:nth-child(1) {
  animation-delay: 0ms;
}
.item:nth-child(2) {
  animation-delay: 50ms;
}
.item:nth-child(3) {
  animation-delay: 100ms;
}
.item:nth-child(4) {
  animation-delay: 150ms;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

Keep stagger delays short (30-80ms between items). Long delays make the interface feel slow. Stagger is decorative — never block interaction while stagger animations are playing.

## Debugging Animations

### Slow motion testing

Play animations at reduced speed to spot issues invisible at full speed. Temporarily increase duration to 2-5x normal, or use browser DevTools animation inspector to slow playback.

Things to look for in slow motion:

- Do colors transition smoothly, or do you see two distinct states overlapping?
- Does the easing feel right, or does it start/stop abruptly?
- Is the transform-origin correct, or does the element scale from the wrong point?
- Are multiple animated properties (opacity, transform, color) in sync?

### Frame-by-frame inspection

Step through animations frame by frame in Chrome DevTools (Animations panel). This reveals timing issues between coordinated properties that you cannot see at full speed.

### Device testing when needed

For touch interactions, use the available browser or device environment to verify the affected pointer lifecycle and interruptions. Physical hardware can resolve uncertain gesture feel or browser-specific behavior; when available, a phone connected to Safari's remote devtools is one option. Report what the environment could not verify.
